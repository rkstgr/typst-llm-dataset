      "raw": "Hi William,\n\nI looked into your request and developed a solution that combines two different approaches. The goal is to define global settings for plots in a centralized way and have a function that automatically applies these settings to every graph.\n\n**First Approach: Global Settings**  \nI created a `plot-settings` variable that stores various parameters like `x-grid` or `axis-style`. This allows you to define these values in one place and reuse them in every plot.\n\n```typ\n#let plot-settings = (\n  x-format: v => text(6pt,str(v)),\n  y-format: v => text(6pt,str(v)),\n  x-grid: \"both\",\n  axis-style: \"scientific-auto\",\n)\n```\n\n**Second Approach: A Wrapper Function**  \nAdditionally, I implemented a `william-graph` function that automatically applies axis styling. This way, you don’t have to manually define styling each time.\n\n```typ\n#let william-graph(body) = canvas({\n  import draw: *\n  set-style(axes: (\n      stroke: 0.5pt, \n      tick: (\n        stroke:0.5pt,\n      ),\n      grid: (\n        stroke: gray + 0.5pt,\n        dashed: \"dotted\",\n      )\n    )\n  )\n  body\n})\n```\n\n**Example Usage**  \nHere, the function is used to create a plot with global settings and predefined axis styling:\n\n```typ\n#william-graph({\n  plot.plot(size: (5,2), x-tick-step: 2,\n  y-tick-step: 5,\n  x-label: text(7pt, [displacement (m) [west]]),\n  y-label: text(7pt, [Force (N) [west]]),\n  y-max: 25,\n  x-max: 14,\n  y-grid:\"both\",\n  title: \"Filled\",\n  ..plot-settings,\n  grid-style: (stroke: blue),\n  {\n    plot.add-fill-between(\n      ((0,10),(2,20), (12,20)),\n      ((0,0),(12,0),), style: (stroke: none))\n    plot.add(((0,10),(2,20),(12,20)), style: (stroke: black, ))\n  }\n)\n})\n```\n\nThis setup allows you to manage your plots more easily and maintain consistent styling.
