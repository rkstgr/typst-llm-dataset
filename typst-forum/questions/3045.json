Does Typst have a built-in feature or a recommended approach for auto-scaling text to fit a predefined box size? Ideally, I’d love a way to ensure the text dynamically adjusts-shrinking when it’s too long or enlarging when it’s too short- while staying legible and respecting the box boundaries.</p>\n<p>If this isn’t natively supported, has anyone implemented a workaround (e.g., via scripting or preprocessing)? I’d appreciate any tips, code examples, or pointers to relevant documentation.
