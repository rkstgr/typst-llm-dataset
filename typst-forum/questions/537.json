But a huge advantage that I didnâ€™t know is that you can connect to multiple files and modify all of them without touching the browser! This means, for example, if I connect to <code>main.typ</code>, create and connect to <code>other.typ</code>, then I can type in both buffers and all the changes will apply in real time. I can, for example, do <code>#include \"other.typ\"</code> in <code>main.typ</code> and write something in <code>other.typ</code> then it will show this in the preview, even though visually the <code>other.typ</code> file is selected in the web app (not <code>main.typ</code>). I think this is a huge productivity boost as you donâ€™t need to constantly click between files in the web app and just switch between them in your editor.</p>",
