I have it just about working, but I’d like to remove from extra bits the compiler provides to the output that my static site generator already provides. For example, the compiler currently outputs the following in every file:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"typ\"><code class=\"lang-typ\"> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;CONTENT HERE&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there any way to output say, only the  tags?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
