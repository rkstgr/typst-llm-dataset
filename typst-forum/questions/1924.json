(Unfortunately, this behaviour is not properly documented.)\n\nThe following example demonstrates the feature:\n\n```typ\n#set page(\n  paper: \"a8\",\n  margin: 40pt,\n  header: context counter(page).display(),\n  footer: context counter(page).display(),\n)\n\nA\n\n// Try uncommenting each of the pagebreaks in turn:\n// #pagebreak()\n#counter(page).update(5)\n// #pagebreak(weak: true)\n\nB\n```\n\nWith this, you can fix the first problem of your page numbering (that numbers are off by one). The second part (which is not exhibited by your example) is more problematic: The final value will _always_ corresponds to the page number at the very end of the document, not to the end of the \"section\". There is no built-in feature for this at the moment, but it can be realized with a slightly more manual setup, which I've implemented below:\n\n```typ\n// Returns the page total of the current section.\n#let reset = <__reset>\n#let subtotal() = {\n  let loc = here()\n  let list = query(selector(reset).after(loc))\n  if list.len() > 0 { \n    counter(page).at(list.first().location()).first() - 1\n  } else {\n    counter(page).final().first()\n  }\n}\n\n// A section of content with reset page numbering.\n//\n// Leaves a marker we can query to find the subtotal page number.\n// Resets the page counter in between the pages.\n#let section(it) = {\n  pagebreak(weak: true)\n  [#metadata(none)#reset]\n  counter(page).update(1)\n  pagebreak(weak: true)\n  it\n}\n\n#let page-numbers = context numbering(\n  \"1 / 1\",\n  ..counter(page).get(),\n  subtotal(),\n)\n\n#set page(\n  paper: \"a8\",\n  margin: 40pt,\n  // Show both in the header & footer to see the effect.\n  header: align(center, page-numbers),\n  footer: align(center, page-numbers),\n)\n\n#section([= A] + lorem(30))\n#section([= B] + lorem(60))\n#section([= C] + lorem(30))\n```",
