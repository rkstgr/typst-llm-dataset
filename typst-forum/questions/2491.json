      "cooked": "<p>I’m experiencing an issue with Typst’s GitHub integration where I can’t connect to my organization’s repositories. When using the GitHub integration in Typst’s web app, the dropdown menu labeled “Organizations” only displays my personal account, despite me owning and belonging to several organizations. I created these organizations using the same GitHub account that I’m using for Typst. I’ve tried disconnecting and reconnecting the GitHub integration, but the organizations still don’t appear in the dropdown. Is this a known limitation of the integration, or is there perhaps a permissions issue I need to resolve? Any guidance on how to connect Typst to a GitHub organization would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
