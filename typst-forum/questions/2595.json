      "cooked": "<p>In Polylux 0.3.2, it was possible to access <code>logic.logical-slide</code>, which is a logical counter for the slide number. For me, it was convenient to create a presentation appendix containing backup slides: the first slides until the conclusion had normal numbering (1, 2, 3…), but after that, the appendix slides had roman numbering (i, ii, iii…). To do that, I had to reset <code>logic.logical-slide</code> to 0 after the conclusion.</p>\n<p>However, that doesn’t seem possible in Polylux 0.4, because <code>logic.logical-slide</code> is no longer exposed in the API. Now, you have access to <code>toolbox.slide-number</code> and <code>toolbox.last-slide-number</code>, which respectively give the current and last slide numbers, but as far as I know, you cannot reset the logical slide counter.</p>\n<p>Is there a new method to do that in Polylux 0.4?</p>",
