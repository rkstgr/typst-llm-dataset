= bytes

A sequence of bytes.

This is conceptually similar to an array of #link("/docs/reference/foundations/int/")[integers] between `0` and `255`, but represented much more efficiently. You can iterate over it using a #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#loops")[for loop].

You can convert

- a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/str/")[string] or an #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/")[array] of integers to bytes with the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/")[bytes] constructor
- bytes to a string with the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/str/")[str] constructor, with UTF-8 encoding
- bytes to an array of integers with the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/")[array] constructor

When #link("/docs/reference/data-loading/read/")[reading] data from a file, you can decide whether to load it as a string or as raw bytes.

```typst
#bytes((123, 160, 22, 0)) \
#bytes("Hello ðŸ˜ƒ")

#let data = read(
  "rhino.png",
  encoding: none,
)

// Magic bytes.
#array(data.slice(0, 4)) \
#str(data.slice(1, 4))
```

== Constructor

Converts a value to bytes.

- Strings are encoded in UTF-8.
- Arrays of integers between `0` and `255` are converted directly. The dedicated byte representation is much more efficient than the array representation and thus typically used for large byte buffers (e.g. image data).

```
bytes(
  str: str | bytes | array
) -> bytes
```

```typst
#bytes("Hello ðŸ˜ƒ") \
#bytes((123, 160, 22, 0))
```

==== `value`: str | bytes | array (Required, Positional)

The value that should be converted to bytes.

== Definitions

=== `len`

The length in bytes.

```
len(
  
) -> int
```

=== `at`

Returns the byte at the specified index. Returns the default value if the index is out of bounds or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

```
at(
  int: int,
  default: any
) -> int
```

==== `index`: int (Required, Positional)

The index at which to retrieve the byte.

==== `default`: any

A default value to return if the index is out of bounds.

=== `slice`

Extracts a subslice of the bytes. Fails with an error if the start or end index is out of bounds.

```
slice(
  int: int,
  none: none | int,
  count: int
) -> bytes
```

==== `start`: int (Required, Positional)

The start index (inclusive).

==== `end`: none | int (Positional)

The end index (exclusive). If omitted, the whole slice until the end is extracted.

Default: `none`

==== `count`: int

The number of items to extract. This is equivalent to passing `start + count` as the `end` position. Mutually exclusive with `end`.
