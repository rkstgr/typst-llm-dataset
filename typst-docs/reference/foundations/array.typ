= array

A sequence of values.

You can construct an array by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values in parentheses. The values do not have to be of the same type.

You can access and update array items with the `.at()` method. Indices are zero-based and negative indices wrap around to the end of the array. You can iterate over an array using a #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#loops")[for loop]. Arrays can be added together with the `+` operator, #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#blocks")[joined together] and multiplied with integers.

*Note:* An array of length one needs a trailing comma, as in `(1,)`. This is to disambiguate from a simple parenthesized expressions like `(1 + 2) * 3`. An empty array is written as `()`.

== Example

```typst
#let values = (1, 7, 4, -3, 2)

#values.at(0) \
#(values.at(0) = 3)
#values.at(-1) \
#values.find(calc.even) \
#values.filter(calc.odd) \
#values.map(calc.abs) \
#values.rev() \
#(1, (2, 3)).flatten() \
#(("A", "B", "C")
    .join(", ", last: " and "))
```

== Constructor

Converts a value to an array.

Note that this function is only intended for conversion of a collection-like value to an array, not for creation of an array from individual items. Use the array syntax `(1, 2, 3)` (or `(1,)` for a single-element array) instead.

```
array(
  bytes: bytes | array | version
) -> array
```

```typst
#let hi = "Hello ğŸ˜ƒ"
#array(bytes(hi))
```

==== `value`: bytes | array | version (Required, Positional)

The value that should be converted to an array.

== Definitions

=== `len`

The number of values in the array.

```
len(
  
) -> int
```

=== `first`

Returns the first item in the array. May be used on the left-hand side of an assignment. Fails with an error if the array is empty.

```
first(
  
) -> 
```

=== `last`

Returns the last item in the array. May be used on the left-hand side of an assignment. Fails with an error if the array is empty.

```
last(
  
) -> 
```

=== `at`

Returns the item at the specified index in the array. May be used on the left-hand side of an assignment. Returns the default value if the index is out of bounds or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

```
at(
  int: int,
  default: any
) -> int
```

==== `index`: int (Required, Positional)

The index at which to retrieve the item. If negative, indexes from the back.

==== `default`: any

A default value to return if the index is out of bounds.

=== `push`

Adds a value to the end of the array.

```
push(
  any
) -> 
```

==== `value`: any (Required, Positional)

The value to insert at the end of the array.

=== `pop`

Removes the last item from the array and returns it. Fails with an error if the array is empty.

```
pop(
  
) -> 
```

=== `insert`

Inserts a value into the array at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements to the right. Fails with an error if the index is out of bounds.

To replace an element of an array, use #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-at")[at].

```
insert(
  int: int,
  any
) -> int
```

==== `index`: int (Required, Positional)

The index at which to insert the item. If negative, indexes from the back.

==== `value`: any (Required, Positional)

The value to insert into the array.

=== `remove`

Removes the value at the specified index from the array and return it.

```
remove(
  int: int,
  default: any
) -> int
```

==== `index`: int (Required, Positional)

The index at which to remove the item. If negative, indexes from the back.

```
slice(
  int: int,
  none: none | int,
  count: int
) -> array
```

==== `start`: int (Required, Positional)

The start index (inclusive). If negative, indexes from the back.

==== `end`: none | int (Positional)

The end index (exclusive). If omitted, the whole slice until the end of the array is extracted. If negative, indexes from the back.

Default: `none`

==== `count`: int

The number of items to extract. This is equivalent to passing `start + count` as the `end` position. Mutually exclusive with `end`.

=== `contains`

Whether the array contains the specified value.

This method also has dedicated syntax: You can write `2 in (1, 2, 3)` instead of `(1, 2, 3).contains(2)`.

```
contains(
  any
) -> bool
```

==== `value`: any (Required, Positional)

The value to search for.

=== `find`

  function: function
) -> int
```

==== `searcher`: function (Required, Positional)

The function to apply to each item. Must return a boolean.

=== `range`

Create an array consisting of a sequence of numbers.

If you pass just one positional parameter, it is interpreted as the `end` of the range. If you pass two, they describe the `start` and `end` of the range.

This function is available both in the array function's scope and globally.

```
range(
  int: int,
  int: int,
  step: int
) -> array

#range(21, step: 4) \
#range(5, 2, step: -1)
```

==== `start`: int (Positional)

The start of the range (inclusive).

Default: `0`

==== `end`: int (Required, Positional)

The end of the range (exclusive).

==== `step`: int

The distance between the generated numbers.

Default: `1`

=== `filter`

```
enumerate(
  start: int
) -> array
```

==== `start`: int

The index returned for the first pair of the returned list.

Default: `0`

=== `zip`

Zips the array with other arrays.

Returns an array of arrays, where the `i`th inner array contains all the `i`th elements from each original array.

If the arrays to be zipped have different lengths, they are zipped up to the last element of the shortest array and all remaining elements are ignored.

This function is variadic, meaning that you can zip multiple arrays together at once: `(1, 2).zip(("A", "B"), (10, 20))` yields `((1, "A", 10), (2, "B", 20))`.

```
zip(
  exact: bool,
  ..: array
) -> array
```

==== `exact`: bool

Whether all arrays have to have the same length. For example, `(1, 2).zip((1, 2, 3), exact: true)` produces an error.

Default: `false`

==== `others`: array (Required, Positional, Variadic)

The arrays to zip with.

=== `fold`

The initial value to start with.

==== `folder`: function (Required, Positional)

The folding function. Must have two parameters: One for the accumulated value and one for an item.

=== `sum`

Sums all items (works for all types that can be added).

```
sum(

) -> 
```

==== `default`: any

What to return if the array is empty. Must be set if the array can be empty.

=== `product`

Calculates the product all items (works for all types that can be multiplied).

```
product(
  default: any
) -> 
```

==== `default`: any

What to return if the array is empty. Must be set if the array can be empty.

=== `any`

Whether the given function returns `true` for any item in the array.

```
any(
  function: function
) -> bool
```

==== `test`: function (Required, Positional)

The function to apply to each item. Must return a boolean.

=== `all`

Whether the given function returns `true` for all items in the array.

```
all(
  function: function
) -> bool
```

==== `test`: function (Required, Positional)

The function to apply to each item. Must return a boolean.

=== `flatten`

Combine all nested arrays into a single flat one.

```
flatten(
  
) -> array
```

) -> none
```

==== `separator`: any | none (Positional)

A value to insert between each item of the array.

Default: `none`

==== `last`: any

An alternative separator between the last two items.

=== `intersperse`

Returns an array with a copy of the separator value placed between adjacent elements.

```
intersperse(
  any
) -> array
```

==== `separator`: any (Required, Positional)

The value that will be placed between each adjacent element.

=== `chunks`

Splits an array into non-overlapping chunks, starting at the beginning, ending with a single remainder chunk.

All chunks but the last have `chunk-size` elements. If `exact` is set to `true`, the remainder is dropped if it contains less than `chunk-size` elements.

```
chunks(
  int: int,
  exact: bool
) -> array
```

```typst
#let array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
#array.chunks(3) \
#array.chunks(3, exact: true)
```

==== `chunk-size`: int (Required, Positional)

How many elements each chunk may at most contain.

==== `exact`: bool

Whether to keep the remainder if its size is less than `chunk-size`.

Default: `false`

=== `windows`

Returns sliding windows of `window-size` elements over an array.

If the array length is less than `window-size`, this will return an empty array.

```
windows(
  int: int
) -> array
```

```typst
#let array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
#array.windows(5)
```

==== `window-size`: int (Required, Positional)

How many elements each window will contain.

=== `sorted`

Return a sorted version of this array, optionally by a given key function. The sorting algorithm used is stable.

Returns an error if two values could not be compared or if the key function (if given) yields an error.

To sort according to multiple criteria at once, e.g. in case of equality between some criteria, the key function can return an array. The results are in lexicographic order.

```
sorted(
  key: function
) -> array
```

```typst
#let array = (
  (a: 2, b: 4),
  (a: 1, b: 5),
  (a: 2, b: 3),
)
#array.sorted(key: it => (it.a, it.b))
```

==== `key`: function

If given, applies this function to the elements in the array to determine the keys to sort by.

=== `dedup`

Deduplicates all items in the array.

Returns a new array with all duplicate items removed. Only the first element of each duplicate is kept.

```
dedup(
  key: function
) -> array
```

```typst
#(1, 1, 2, 3, 1).dedup()
```

==== `key`: function

If given, applies this function to the elements in the array to determine the keys to deduplicate by.

=== `to-dict`

Converts an array of pairs into a dictionary. The first value of each pair is the key, the second the value.

If the same key occurs multiple times, the last value is selected.

```
to-dict(
  
) -> dictionary
```

```typst
#(
  ("apples", 2),
  ("peaches", 3),
  ("apples", 5),
).to-dict()
```

=== `reduce`

Reduces the elements to a single one, by repeatedly applying a reducing operation.

If the array is empty, returns `none`, otherwise, returns the result of the reduction.

The reducing function is a closure with two arguments: an "accumulator", and an element.

For arrays with at least one element, this is the same as #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-fold")[array.fold] with the first element of the array as the initial accumulator value, folding every subsequent element into it.

```
reduce(
  function: function
) -> function
```

==== `reducer`: function (Required, Positional)

The reducing function. Must have two parameters: One for the accumulated value and one for an item.
