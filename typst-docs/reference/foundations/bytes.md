# bytes

A sequence of bytes.

This is conceptually similar to an array of [integers](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) between `0` and `255`, but represented much more efficiently. You can iterate over it using a [for loop](/docs/reference/scripting/#loops).

You can convert

- a [string](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) or an [array](/docs/reference/foundations/array/) of integers to bytes with the [bytes](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/) constructor
- bytes to a string with the [str](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) constructor, with UTF-8 encoding
- bytes to an array of integers with the [array](/docs/reference/foundations/array/) constructor

When [reading](/docs/reference/data-loading/read/) data from a file, you can decide whether to load it as a string or as raw bytes.

```typst
#bytes((123, 160, 22, 0)) \
#bytes("Hello ðŸ˜ƒ")

#let data = read(
  "rhino.png",
  encoding: none,
)

// Magic bytes.
#array(data.slice(0, 4)) \
#str(data.slice(1, 4))
```

## Constructor

Converts a value to bytes.

- Strings are encoded in UTF-8.
- Arrays of integers between `0` and `255` are converted directly. The dedicated byte representation is much more efficient than the array representation and thus typically used for large byte buffers (e.g. image data).

```
bytes(
  str: str | bytes | array
) -> bytes
```

```typst
#bytes("Hello ðŸ˜ƒ") \
#bytes((123, 160, 22, 0))
```

#### `value`: str | bytes | array (Required, Positional)

The value that should be converted to bytes.

## Definitions

### `len`

The length in bytes.

```
len(
  
) -> int
```

### `at`

Returns the byte at the specified index. Returns the default value if the index is out of bounds or fails with an error if no default value was specified.

```
at(
  int: int,
  default: any
) -> int
```

#### `index`: int (Required, Positional)

The index at which to retrieve the byte.

#### `default`: any

A default value to return if the index is out of bounds.

### `slice`

Extracts a subslice of the bytes. Fails with an error if the start or end index is out of bounds.

```
slice(
  int: int,
  none: none | int,
  count: int
) -> bytes
```

#### `start`: int (Required, Positional)

The start index (inclusive).

#### `end`: none | int (Positional)

The end index (exclusive). If omitted, the whole slice until the end is extracted.

Default: `none`

#### `count`: int

The number of items to extract. This is equivalent to passing `start + count` as the `end` position. Mutually exclusive with `end`.
