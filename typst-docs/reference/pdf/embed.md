# embed

A file that will be embedded into the output PDF.

This can be used to distribute additional files that are related to the PDF within it. PDF readers will display the files in a file listing.

Some international standards use this mechanism to embed machine-readable data (e.g., ZUGFeRD/Factur-X for invoices) that mirrors the visual content of the PDF.

## Example

## Notes

- This element is ignored if exporting to a format other than PDF.
- File embeddings are not currently supported for PDF/A-2, even if the embedded file conforms to PDF/A-1 or PDF/A-2.
