# metadata

Exposes a value to the query system without producing visible content.

This element can be retrieved with the [query](/docs/reference/introspection/query/) function and from the command line with [typst query](/docs/reference/introspection/query/#command-line-queries). Its purpose is to expose an arbitrary value to the introspection system. To identify a metadata value among others, you can attach a [label](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) to it and query for that label.

The `metadata` element is especially useful for command line queries because it allows you to expose arbitrary values to the outside world.

```typst
// Put metadata somewhere.
#metadata("This is a note") <note>

// And find it from anywhere else.
#context {
  query(<note>).first().value
}
```

## Parameters

```
metadata(
  any
) -> content
```

### `value`: any (Required, Positional)

The value to embed into the document.
