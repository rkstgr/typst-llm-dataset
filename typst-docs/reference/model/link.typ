= link

Links to a URL or a location in the document.

By default, links do not look any different from normal text. However, you can easily apply a style of your choice with a show rule.

== Example

```typst
#show link: underline

https://example.com \

#link("https://example.com") \
#link("https://example.com")[
  See example.com
]
```

== Hyphenation

If you enable hyphenation or justification, by default, it will not apply to links to prevent unwanted hyphenation in URLs. You can opt out of this default via `show link: set text(hyphenate: true)`.

== Syntax

This function also has dedicated syntax: Text that starts with `http://` or `https://` is automatically turned into a link.

== Parameters

```
link(
  str: str | label | location | dictionary,
  content: content
) -> content
```

=== `dest`: str | label | location | dictionary (Required, Positional)

The destination the link points to.

- To link to web pages, dest should be a valid URL string. If the URL is in the mailto: or tel: scheme and the body parameter is omitted, the email address or phone number will be the link's body, without the scheme.
- To link to another part of the document, dest can take one of three forms: A label attached to an element. If you also want automatic text for the link based on the element, consider using a reference instead. A location (typically retrieved from here, locate or query). A dictionary with a page key of type integer and x and y coordinates of type length. Pages are counted from one, and the coordinates are relative to the page's top left corner.

*Example:*
```typst
= Introduction <intro>
#link("mailto:hello@typst.app") \
#link(<intro>)[Go to intro] \
#link((page: 1, x: 0pt, y: 0pt))[
  Go to top
]
```

=== `body`: content (Required, Positional)

The content that should become a link.

If `dest` is an URL string, the parameter can be omitted. In this case, the URL will be shown as the link.
