# layout

Provides access to the current outer container's (or page's, if none) dimensions (width and height).

Accepts a function that receives a single parameter, which is a dictionary with keys `width` and `height`, both of type [length](/docs/reference/layout/length/). The function is provided [context](/docs/reference/context/), meaning you don't need to use it in combination with the `context` keyword. This is why [measure](/docs/reference/layout/measure/) can be called in the example below.

```typst
#let text = lorem(30)
#layout(size => [
  #let (height,) = measure(
    block(width: size.width, text),
  )
  This text is #height high with
  the current page width: \
  #text
])
```

Note that the `layout` function forces its contents into a [block](/docs/reference/layout/block/)-level container, so placement relative to the page or pagebreaks are not possible within it.

If the `layout` call is placed inside a box with a width of `800pt` and a height of `400pt`, then the specified function will be given the argument `(width: 800pt, height: 400pt)`. If it is placed directly into the page, it receives the page's dimensions minus its margins. This is mostly useful in combination with [measurement](/docs/reference/layout/measure/).

You can also use this function to resolve [ratio](/docs/reference/layout/ratio/) to fixed lengths. This might come in handy if you're building your own layout abstractions.

```typst
#layout(size => {
  let half = 50% * size.width
  [Half a page is #half wide.]
})
```

Note that the width or height provided by `layout` will be infinite if the corresponding page dimension is set to `auto`.

## Parameters

```
layout(
  function: function
) -> content
```

### `func`: function (Required, Positional)

A function to call with the outer container's size. Its return value is displayed in the document.

The container's size is given as a [dictionary](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) with the keys `width` and `height`.

This function is called once for each time the content returned by `layout` appears in the document. This makes it possible to generate content that depends on the dimensions of its container.
