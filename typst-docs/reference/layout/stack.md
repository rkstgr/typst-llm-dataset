# stack

Arranges content and spacing horizontally or vertically.

The stack places a list of items along an axis, with optional spacing between each item.

## Example

```typst
#stack(
  dir: ttb,
  rect(width: 40pt),
  rect(width: 120pt),
  rect(width: 90pt),
)
```

## Parameters

```
stack(
  dir: direction,
  spacing: none | relative | fraction,
  ..: relative | fraction | content
) -> content
```

### `dir`: direction (Settable)

The direction along which the items are stacked. Possible values are:

- `ltr`: Left to right.
- `rtl`: Right to left.
- `ttb`: Top to bottom.
- `btt`: Bottom to top.

You can use the `start` and `end` methods to obtain the initial and final points (respectively) of a direction, as `alignment`. You can also use the `axis` method to determine whether a direction is `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"`. The `inv` method returns a direction's inverse direction.

For example, `ttb.start()` is `top`, `ttb.end()` is `bottom`, `ttb.axis()` is `"vertical"` and `ttb.inv()` is equal to `btt`.

Default: `ttb`

### `spacing`: none | relative | fraction (Settable)

Spacing to insert between items where no explicit spacing was provided.

Default: `none`

### `children`: relative | fraction | content (Required, Positional, Variadic)

The children to stack along the axis.
