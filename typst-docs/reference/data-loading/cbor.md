# cbor

Reads structured data from a CBOR file.

The file must contain a valid CBOR serialization. Mappings will be converted into Typst dictionaries, and sequences will be converted into Typst arrays. Strings and booleans will be converted into the Typst equivalents, null-values (`null`, `~` or empty ``) will be converted into `none`, and numbers will be converted to floats or integers depending on whether they are whole numbers.

Be aware that integers larger than 263-1 will be converted to floating point numbers, which may result in an approximative value.

## Parameters

```
cbor(
  str: str | bytes
) -> bytes
```

### `source`: str | bytes (Required, Positional)

A [path](/docs/reference/syntax/#paths) to a CBOR file or raw CBOR bytes.

### `encode`
