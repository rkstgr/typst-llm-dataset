# path

A path through a list of points, connected by Bézier curves.

## Example

```typst
#path(
  fill: blue.lighten(80%),
  stroke: blue,
  closed: true,
  (0pt, 50pt),
  (100%, 50pt),
  ((50%, 0pt), (40pt, 0pt)),
)
```

## Parameters

```
path(
  fill: none | color | gradient | tiling,
  fill-rule: str,
  stroke: none | auto | length | color | gradient | stroke | tiling | dictionary,
  closed: bool,
  ..: array
) -> content
```

### `fill`: none | color | gradient | tiling (Settable)

How to fill the path.

When setting a fill, the default stroke disappears. To create a rectangle with both fill and stroke, you have to configure both.

Default: `none`

### `fill-rule`: str (Settable)

The drawing rule used to fill the path.

Default: `"non-zero"`

**Example:**
```typst
// We use `.with` to get a new
// function that has the common
// arguments pre-applied.
#let star = path.with(
  fill: red,
  closed: true,
  (25pt, 0pt),
  (10pt, 50pt),
  (50pt, 20pt),
  (0pt, 20pt),
  (40pt, 50pt),
)

#star(fill-rule: "non-zero")
#star(fill-rule: "even-odd")
```

### `stroke`: none | auto | length | color | gradient | stroke | tiling | dictionary (Settable)

How to [stroke](/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/) the path. This can be:

Can be set to `none` to disable the stroke or to `auto` for a stroke of `1pt` black if and if only if no fill is given.

Default: `auto`

### `closed`: bool (Settable)

Whether to close this path with one last Bézier curve. This curve will take into account the adjacent control points. If you want to close with a straight line, simply add one last point that's the same as the start point.

Default: `false`

### `vertices`: array (Required, Positional, Variadic)

The vertices of the path.

Each vertex can be defined in 3 ways:

- A regular point, as given to the [line](/docs/reference/visualize/line/) or [polygon](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/) function.
- An array of two points, the first being the vertex and the second being the control point. The control point is expressed relative to the vertex and is mirrored to get the second control point. The given control point is the one that affects the curve coming *into* this vertex (even for the first point). The mirrored control point affects the curve going out of this vertex.
- An array of three points, the first being the vertex and the next being the control points (control point for curves coming in and out, respectively).
